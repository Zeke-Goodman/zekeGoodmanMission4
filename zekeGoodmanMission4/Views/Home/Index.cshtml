        <h2>What is pickleball?</h2>
        <p>Pickleball is a paddle sport that combines elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong. Played on a court with similar dimensions to a doubles badminton court, pickleball utilizes a perforated plastic ball and solid paddles made of wood or composite materials. The game is typically played in doubles format, though singles play is also common. Players serve underhand and must allow the ball to bounce once on each side before volleys are permitted. Pickleball emphasizes both finesse and power, requiring players to strategically place shots while maintaining quick reflexes. The sport's quirky name has several origin stories, one of which involves the founders' dog, Pickles, who chased after errant balls during the game's early development. With its simple rules, fast-paced action, and accessibility to players of all ages and skill levels, pickleball has gained widespread popularity in recent years, becoming a beloved pastime in communities around the world.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Pickleball:</h2>
        <p>Pickleball, a rapidly growing sport, offers a multitude of benefits that appeal to players of all ages and skill levels. One key advantage lies in its accessibility, as pickleball courts can be found in various settings, including community centers, parks, and even makeshift setups in driveways. Its simple rules and relatively easy-to-learn techniques make it appealing to beginners, while still offering challenges for seasoned athletes. The sport's compact court size and slower-paced gameplay reduce the risk of injuries, making it particularly attractive for seniors and those rehabilitating from injuries. Furthermore, pickleball fosters social interaction and camaraderie, as it often involves doubles play, encouraging teamwork and communication. Beyond the physical benefits of improved cardiovascular health, coordination, and flexibility, pickleball provides mental stimulation, promoting strategic thinking and quick decision-making. Overall, pickleball's inclusive nature, combined with its physical and mental benefits, makes it a highly enjoyable and rewarding activity for participants of all backgrounds.</p>

    <!-- How to Play Section -->
    <div class="container-lg">
        <h2>How to play:</h2>
        <p><strong>Court and Equipment:</strong> Pickleball is typically played on a badminton-sized court (20 feet wide and 44 feet long), with a net lowered to 36 inches at the ends and 34 inches in the middle. Players use solid paddles made of wood or composite materials, and a plastic ball with holes, similar to a wiffle ball.</p>
        <p><strong>Scoring:</strong> Pickleball can be played in singles or doubles. The game is usually played to 11 points, and you must win by at least two points. Points are scored only by the serving team.</p>
        <p><strong>Service:</strong> The serving team must stand behind the baseline and serve the ball diagonally cross-court to the opponent's service court. The serve must be underhand and contact the ball below the waist. The serve must clear the net and land in the opponent's service court without touching the non-volley zone (the area within 7 feet of the net).</p>
        <p><strong>Volleys:</strong> Volleys are shots hit in the air before the ball bounces on the court. Players are not allowed to volley the ball while standing within the non-volley zone (the area within 7 feet of the net). This is often referred to as the "kitchen" rule.</p>
        <p><strong>Double Bounce Rule:</strong> After the serve, both teams must let the ball bounce once before volleying. After the two bounces, players can either volley the ball (hit it before it bounces) or let it bounce before hitting it.</p>
        <p><strong>Faults:</strong> A fault occurs when a player fails to follow the rules, such as hitting the ball out of bounds, into the net, or failing to clear the non-volley zone during a volley. When a fault occurs, the opposing team receives a point and the next serve.</p>
        <p><strong>Serve Rotation:</strong> In doubles play, the serving team continues to serve until they commit a fault. Afterward, the serve rotates to the opposing team. Only the serving team can score points.</p>
        <p><strong>Winning the Game:</strong> The first team to reach 11 points and have a lead of at least two points wins the game. If the score reaches 10-10, the game continues until one team achieves a two-point lead.</p>
